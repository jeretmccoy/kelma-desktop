"""Propagate per-card scheduling between the master and a service shadow.

Why this exists: the reconcile copies decks with Anki's apkg importer, which
matches cards by (note, template ordinal) and *skips* any card that already
exists — its source carries a literal `// TODO: could update existing card`. So
when you review a card on one device, the note content still merges by GUID, but
the card's scheduling state (queue / due / interval / ease / reps / lapses /
FSRS data) is never carried to the matching card on the other side. Reviews
silently don't sync.

This module fills that gap. For the given decks it pairs cards across the two
collections by (note GUID, template ordinal) — the stable identity, since the
importer assigns each collection its own card ids — and, newest-mtime-wins,
copies the scheduling columns from src to dst, marking the dst card pending
(usn=-1) so the shadow's native sync uploads it.

Date correctness: review and day-learn `due`/`odue` values are stored as days
since each collection's creation (`crt`). When the two collections were created
at different times they must be shifted by the crt delta — exactly what the
importer does for newly-added cards. When the crt values match (the common case
for one account), the delta is 0 and this is a plain copy. Cards sitting in a
filtered deck (`odid != 0`) on either side are left untouched: their odue
bookkeeping is fragile and filtered decks are transient.
